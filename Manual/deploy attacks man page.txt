Description
	Deploy attacks is a simple bash shell script that use hping3 tools to create flood attacks. (for more info about hping3, see hping3 man page).
	This program also combine 3 types of DoS attack into a single command such as ICMP Flood, TCP Flood, and UDP Flood.
	And when you run the program with default mode, it will run flood attack with spoof source and maximum data as big as MTU can hold.
	The program will run for only 60secs, because maybe if you capture the flood attacks using any-tools that can capture packet it will overuse your resources.
	To use the program, change the permission for this file if you run the program for the first time. use chmod +x or chmod 755.	
	Run the program without any flag will output nothing. So, run with option flag instead.
	You can use -h or --help, to see help.
	
Flag option
	-t --target-host | Target Host
		Specify the target to send the flood attacks
		e.g. -t 127.0.0.1
		     --target-host=127.0.0.1
		You must use this flag to run the program.

	-a --attack-mode | Attack Mode
		Specify the attack mode to attack the target
		use "FLOOD" mode for send the flood attacks ASAP, "FAST" mode to atttack with 0.5sec interval or you can use "NORMAL" mode with 1sec interval.
		e.g. -m flood
		     --mode=normal

	-m --source-mode | Host Source
		Specify the IP address of yours.
		use "SPOOF" source to use source IP with their IP target or use "RANDOM" source to use random IP as source IP.
		e.g. -s sppof
		     --source=random

	-s --data-size | Data Size
		specify the data size
		use "MAX" default program data size without fragmented data, "BIG" default program data size with fragmented data, "MANUAL" customize your own data size.
		e.g. -s big
		     --data-size=max

	-r --runtime | Runtime
		specify time to take to attacks the host and make the target down. (very important to keep your resource stable, start from a short time)
		e.g. -r 60 (where 60 is 60secs = 1min)
		     --runtime=60

	-d --default | Default Mode
		if you do not know how to start, use the default and capture the packet to see how it works. default value can only set to 'true'.
		e.g. -d true
		     --default=true
		You must use this flag to run the program.

	-h --help | Help
		to see help.


Example
	./deployAttacks-V4.sh -t xx.xx.xx.xx -d true | ./deployAttacks-V4.sh --target-host=xx.xx.xx.xx --default=true
		those command let you to run the program with default mode.
		where :
			-) -t --target-host = target host you must to specify
			-) -d --default =
				*) flood mode enabled
				*) spoof source enabled
				*) max size enabled
				*) run for 60secs

	./deployAttacks-V4.sh -t xx.xx.xx.xx -d true -r 100 | ./deployAttacks-V4.sh --target-host=xx.xx.xx.xx --default=true --runtime=100
		or you can run the default mode with specify the run time you want.
